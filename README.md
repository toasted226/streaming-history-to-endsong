# Streaming History To Endsong

## Ever tried to get your Spotify streaming history to import into LastFM?
Well if you got sent your extended streaming history and it was in the form of Streaming_History_Audio_.json instead of endsong_.json, this console application will format it back to endsong.json so that you don't have to send another request.
